# C\* — *THE* CODING LANGUAGE
## What Is C\*?

C\* (`C star`) is a new language designed to incorporte all of the rights of the previous *C* family and combine them into a simple, learnable experience designed for any type of programmer through the use of non-forced paradigms. There is low-level access, high-level syntax, but most importantly there is no forced paradigm compliance — most paradigms can work with each other, though do not expect it to look nice. *C\** is functional, not pretty.

## What Does C\* Bring?

C\* brings a brand new approach to low-level control mixed with high-level syntax. No, this is not Rust, though C\* attempts to solve the memory control issue by implementing basic compiler checks for memory safety. It will not be as intrusive as Rust, and allow for most generally safe programs instead of the strict Rust-safe-only programs &mdash; a pain point that many developers have expressed.

## C Star, Really?
The name `C star` comes from the directive that this derivitive of the C language aims to be the *star* performer of all three worlds and then some. Its syntax is meant to be simple yet descriptive, the encoding is meant to be as close to numerical representation as possible, and most methods are compiled to their most simple <span style="color: #f0f;">Assembly</span> representations
