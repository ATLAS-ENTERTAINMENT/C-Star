# C* — *THE* CODING LANGUAGE
## What is C*?

C\* (`C star`) is a new language designed to incorporte all of the rights of the previous *C* family and combine them into a simple, learnable experience designed for any type of programmer through the use of non-forced paradigms. There is low-level access, high-level syntax, but most importantly there is no forced paradigm compliance — most paradigms can work with each other, though do not expect it to look nice. *C\** is functional, not pretty
